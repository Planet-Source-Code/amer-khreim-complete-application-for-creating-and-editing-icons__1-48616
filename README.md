## Complete application for creating and editing icons


</div>

### Description

his is a 32 bit version of the iconwrks sample which originally

shipped with VB 1.0. This project will also build the 16-bit version

in VB 4.0, but the 16-bit version may have problems running correctly

on Windows NT. This is a straight port, with just enough changes made

to enable this project to run under 32 bit operating systems.
